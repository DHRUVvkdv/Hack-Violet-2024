    Menstruation: 'During the menstrual phase, your body may be more fatigued and sensitive. It is essential to prioritize self-care and not push yourself too hard. Consider focusing on lighter strength training sessions that emphasize full-body movements and muscle engagement without excessive intensity. Use this time to work on stability and mobility exercises. Incorporate exercises such as bodyweight squats, lunges, and gentle core work. Allow for longer rest periods between sets and listen to your body`s` cues for recovery.',
    Follicular: 'As you transition into the follicular phase, energy levels typically rise. This is an opportune time to engage in more dynamic and challenging strength training workouts. Incorporate compound movements that target multiple muscle groups simultaneously. Focus on increasing weights and intensity gradually. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) or circuit training can be effective during this phase to enhance cardiovascular fitness and strength. Embrace exercises like deadlifts, squats, bench presses, and incorporate explosive movements to take advantage of heightened energy levels.',
    Ovulation: 'During the ovulatory phase, estrogen and testosterone levels peak, providing a boost in strength and endurance. Take advantage of this by incorporating more demanding strength training exercises. Challenge yourself with heavier weights and lower rep ranges to promote muscle hypertrophy. Compound movements and powerlifting exercises, such as deadlifts, squats, and overhead presses, can be particularly effective during this phase. Focus on maintaining proper form and control throughout each repetition.',
    Luteal: 'As you enter the luteal phase, you may experience increased PMS symptoms and fatigue. Modify your strength training routine to prioritize stability and control. Consider incorporating more bodyweight exercises, resistance band workouts, and isometric holds. This phase is suitable for targeting specific muscle groups with isolation exercises and incorporating yoga or Pilates movements to promote flexibility and alleviate tension. Be attentive to your bodys signals, and if needed, decrease the overall training volume while maintaining a focus on quality movement.',
  }

  const yogaData = {
    Menstruation: 'Focus: During your period, the body is often fatigued and may experience discomfort. The emphasis is on self-care and gentleness. Yoga Practice: Opt for restorative yoga, which involves gentle, supported poses to promote relaxation. Incorporate slow, mindful movements to ease tension. Poses to Try: Child Pose, Supported Bridge Pose with props, Legs Up the Wall, and gentle seated forward bends.',
    Follicular: 'Focus: Energy levels rise as the body prepares for ovulation. The focus here is on building strength, flexibility, and enhancing mood. Yoga Practice: Engage in more dynamic and invigorating sequences. Include sun salutations, standing poses like Warrior series, and flowing movements to boost vitality. Poses to Try: Sun Salutations, Warrior Poses, Downward Dog, and inversions like Headstand or Handstand (if you are comfortable with them).',
    Ovulation: 'Focus: This phase is marked by increased energy and a sense of openness. Emphasize balance, expansion, and deeper stretching. Yoga Practice: Explore balancing poses that connect mind and body. Incorporate heart-opening postures and deeper stretches. Poses to Try: Tree Pose, Camel Pose, Dancers Pose, and backbends like Cobra or Upward-Facing Dog.',
    Luteal: 'Focus: As the body prepares for menstruation, there may be an increase in emotional and physical symptoms. Prioritize calming and grounding practices. Yoga Practice: Include yin and restorative yoga to ease tension. Focus on hip-opening poses and forward bends to promote relaxation and stress relief. Poses to Try: Pigeon Pose, Seated Forward Bend, Reclining Bound Angle Pose, and supported twists.',

  const cardioData = {
    Menstruation: 'During the menstrual phase, opt for low-impact cardio activities to support the body. Consider activities like brisk walking, cycling, or swimming. Focus on maintaining a moderate intensity to enhance blood flow without excessive strain. Listen to your body and choose activities that feel comfortable and supportive.',
    Follicular: 'As energy levels increase in the follicular phase, incorporate more dynamic and aerobic cardio exercises. Engage in activities like running, dancing, or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to boost cardiovascular fitness. Challenge yourself with varied and enjoyable workouts to capitalize on heightened energy levels.',
    Ovulation: 'During ovulation, take advantage of increased endurance and stamina. Include cardio workouts that elevate the heart rate and promote cardiovascular health. Activities like running, cycling, and group fitness classes can be effective. Experiment with longer duration and varied intensities to enhance overall endurance.',
    Luteal: 'As you enter the luteal phase, be mindful of potential fatigue and mood changes. Opt for lower-impact cardio exercises such as brisk walking, cycling, or elliptical training. Focus on maintaining a steady pace to support cardiovascular health without placing excessive stress on the body. Listen to your bodys cues and choose activities that feel nurturing.',
